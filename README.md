*The package is still under development, you may find serious bugs or features like the pdf translator still missing. Any serious bugs please let me know by discord!*


## Summary and details
---
The **perfect** module to make ***translations*** with no character limitations, ***no need to pay and no need to give your bank details*** to access the API of ***DeepL***. Translate the main ***text files*** (soon also pdf's) or give the ***text directly***!

To fulfill the **purpose**, we make use of ***Selenium*** and the browser [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) therefore, it is ***necessary** to have the browser installed ***on your computer***. If you are on **windows**, download the ***latest version***, if you are on ***linux***, we recommend you to download [this](https://github.com/ElHaban3ro/DeeptransTool/blob/main/packages/google-chrome-linux64-105.0.5195.125.deb?raw=true) version. 



## (v1.4) ¿What's New?
---
- Apparently they changed the structure of how the deepl.com page is built, and therefore, the scrapper stopped working. It's fixed!

- The scrapp system was changed in the text. We now use "Beautifulsoup4" which will prevent us from errors in the future!

## Installation and Use!
---

#### Installation:
To use this package, the best idea is to do it through ***pip***:
```bash
pip install DeeptransTool
```
***IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE "D" AND THE "T" ARE CAPITALIZED.***


Or, on the contrary, you can **clone** this repository and access it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElHaban3ro/DeeptransTool
```

This will create a folder of the project itself inside your python root project. Next we have to install the necessary dependencies for the project to work correctly, this can be done with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

This would **ideally** have to install all the necessary libraries for you. This will be installed in the ***virtual environment*** of your project. See how to create a [virtual environment here]('https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html').


In addition to this, remember to have the ***Chrome*** browser installed on your ***device***. Remember that, if you are on ***Windows***, you should install the ***latest version***, and if you are on ***linux***, [install the version that ***I leave*** in my repository](https://github.com/ElHaban3ro/DeeptransTool/blob/main/packages/google-chrome-linux64-105.0.5195.125.deb?raw=true) (Any problem, contact me by ***Discord*** or ***Twitter***).
